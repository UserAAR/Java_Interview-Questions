📌 **What is Java?**  
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for developing web, desktop, and mobile applications. It is known for its simplicity, robustness, and cross-platform capabilities.  

📌 **What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?**  
Although they share similar names, Java and JavaScript are distinct programming languages designed for different purposes:  
- Java: Used for building standalone applications, such as desktop or mobile apps.  
- JavaScript: Primarily used for adding interactivity to websites and web applications.  

📌 **What is the main principle of Java programming?**  
Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA). This means that once Java code is compiled into bytecode, it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.  

📌 **What are the main features of Java?**  
Java boasts several important features:  
- Platform Independence: Thanks to the JVM, Java code can run on various platforms without modification.  
- Object-Oriented: Java focuses on objects and classes to structure programs.  
- Automatic Memory Management: Java handles memory allocation and deallocation with Garbage Collection.  
- Strong Type Checking: Java enforces strict data type rules to avoid errors at runtime.  

📌 **What is a class in Java?**  
A class in Java is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class can have.  

📌 **What is an object in Java?** 
An object in Java is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or item that contains its own set of attributes and behaviors defined by its class.  

📌 **What is a method in Java?**  
A method in Java is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Methods can be called or invoked to execute their defined functionality.  

📌 **What is the difference between a class and an object?**  
The difference between a class and an object:  
- A class serves as a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects.  
- An object is a specific instance of a class, representing a real entity in your program with its own data and behaviors.  

📌 **What is inheritance in Java?**  
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It allows for code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.  

📌 **What are the types of inheritance in Java?**  
Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass, and multiple inheritance through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple interfaces.  

📌 **What is polymorphism in Java?**  
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code flexibility and reusability.  

📌 **What are the access modifiers in Java?**  
Java provides four access modifiers: public, private, protected, and default (no modifier). They control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.  

📌 **What is encapsulation in Java?**  
Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details and providing a public interface to interact with an object. It helps in achieving data abstraction and protects data from unauthorized access.  

📌 **What is a constructor in Java?**  
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created and has the same name as the class.  

📌 **What is the difference between a constructor and a method?**  
A constructor is a special method used for object initialization and is called automatically when an object is created. A method, on the other hand, is a block of code that performs a specific task and needs to be called explicitly.  

📌 **What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?**  
The JVM is a crucial part of the Java platform. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode and provides a runtime environment in which Java programs can run on any hardware or operating system.
